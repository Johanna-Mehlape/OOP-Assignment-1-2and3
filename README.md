# OOP-Dice-Poker-Game

This is a Dice Poker programe/game which presents a nice graphical interface and engages interactions through mouse clicks.
The build up consists of a number of scripts namely : 
*msdie.py
*button.py
*cdieview.py
*dice.py
*dieview.py
*roller.py
*guipoker.py
*pokerapp.py

The rules of the game are as follows:

    The player starts with $100.
    Each round costs $10 to play. This amount is subtracted from the player’s money at the start of the round.
    The player initially rolls a completely random hand (i.e., all the five dice are rolled).
    The player gets two chances to enhance the hand by rerolling some or all of the dice.
    At the end of the hand, the player’s money is updated according to the following payout schedule:

Hand 	                  Pay
Two Pairs               	5
Three of a Kind 	        8
Full House 	              12
Four of a Kind 	          15
Straight 	                20
Five of a Kind 	          30

The scoring works as follows:
wo pairs is two sets of pairs, for example two threes and two eights in the same hand. A Full House is a pair and a Three of a Kind in the same hand.
Four of a kind is four of the same card, such as four eights. A straight is five numbers in order. So this can be 12345 or 23456. Five of a kind are five of the same number (all sixes for example).
